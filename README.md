# Death rates pre-COVID-19 vs during COVID-19

- - -

We analyzed pre-covid death data and 2020 death data within the US in order to analyse the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic towards the US.

## Questions we wanted to address

* What are the leading causes of death on average?

* How does mortality numbers change depending on location? Are factors such as population density a relevant factor?

* How does 2020 death data compare to the past 10 year average? Where do we see 2020 mortality data deviating the most from past data norms?

## More on our Research

With the obtained data, we wanted to determine the most significant regional and demographic factors that explain variance in death rates across the country. Such factors may include age group, and causes of death (natural, accident, homicide, suidide ect.)  as well as the region (state/county/city) where such deaths occur. Once we were able to identify the leading causes of death on average, to whom and where they occur, we would compare it with 2020 data in an attempt to isolate the effects of Covid-19.    

## Our Findings

* Death rates pre-covid has been increasing gradually each years

* Death rates pre-covid are just a bit higher for males than females

* Death rates pre-covid seem to have increased significantly in the past 4 years for each state

* COVID death rates are minimal compared to other causes of death in 2020 per state and gender

* Death rates exceeded estimates

* Certain metro areas are facing fast rates of infection. For example,  Tuscaloosa,Alaska went from 474 infections to 1672 infected in only one week. This shows the rate of predicted infections per 100k at 491. This leads us to a 253 Percent increase.  

* Within a week there is a sharp increase of covid infections within certain metro areas.
